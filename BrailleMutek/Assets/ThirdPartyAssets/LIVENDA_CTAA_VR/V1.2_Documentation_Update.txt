### UNITY POST PROCESSING STACK V2 BETA INITIAL INTEGRATION 

Below is the instructions to get CTAA working with the upcoming Unity Post Processing Stack V2, Please note this is not a complete or correct integration method at the moment and is not final. In the upcoming updates CTAA will be integrated correctly as a ' Custom Effect ' which can be pluged-in to the PPS V2 at the correct location.

1 :: Setup the PPS V2, create a empty game object and apply the Post Process Volume script and apply a post process Profile, then choose/create a custom layer such as 'postfx' on this gameobject. You can just choose ' Is Global ' and this will apply FX to the entire scene 

2 :: Select the Main Camera and apply the Post Process Layer Script. Select ' No Anti - aliasing ' from the dropdown menu and choose the corresponding layer you have created on the above step such as 'postfx'

3 :: PPS V2 will now be active

4 :: Place the CTAA Script on the Main Camera ' AFTER ' the Post Process Layer Script and CTAA will work as normal.

Please note, as mentioned above, this is an initial integration method and is not final as CTAA will need to be placed on the correct location via a custom plugin method which will be available in the next coming updates.
